# Personal Website
This is my personal website that I'm working on it every once in a while.

This project is written by **html**, **sass**, **css**, **typescript** and it uses **vite** as a build tool. it supports two languages *English* and *Persian* and has two themes *Dark* and *Light*.

By typing `npm run build` in terminal, the build folder in name of *dist* will be created.

*dist* folder is already commited to *gh-pages* branch for deploying on my website address.
As you may know the website is up in [MAHrokh](https://mahrokhnz.ir)
