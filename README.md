# Personal Website
I'm Mahrokh Nabizadeh, <br />
This is my personal website that I update it every once in a while. <br />
This project is written by **HTML**, **Sass**, **css**, **Typescript**, and it uses **Vite** as a build tool. <br />
It supports two languages *English* and *Persian*, and has two themes *Dark* and *Light*. <br />
I tried to use some technologies like Web Components for convenience and cleanliness of my code. <br />
