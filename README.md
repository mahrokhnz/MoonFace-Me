# Personal Website
This is my personal website that I update it every once in a while.

This project is written by **HTML**, **Sass**, **css**, **Typescript** and it uses **Vite** as a build tool. it supports two languages *English* and *Persian* and has two themes *Dark* and *Light*.

By `npm run build`, the build folder in name of *dist* will be created.

*dist* folder is already deployed to *gh-pages* branch by `npm run deploy` on my website address.
As you may know the website is up in [MAHrokh](https://mahrokhnz.ir)
